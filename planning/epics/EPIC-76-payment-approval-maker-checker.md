# EPIC-76 — Payment approval: maker–checker prefix gate

The frozen maker–checker flow is a fifth approval-status axis before the payment business FSM.  It creates the payment and immutable ingress/ISO lineage first, then either releases the existing `payment.received` outbox event or retains the payment at an approval gate.  No new workflow engine, Kafka topic, payment business status, ISO status, finality, or batch aggregate is introduced.

## Story 76.1 — Approval persistence, matrix catalog, and pre-FSM representation

status: done
depends_on: []

Description: Add the source-defined `payment.payment_approvals` and `reference_data.approval_matrix_rules` tables with one-writer-per-schema grants, read-only matrix access from payment, approval-state constraints, and a source-compatible nullable business lifecycle status for pre-FSM pending payments.  Existing no-approval creation remains `RECEIVED`.

Completion criterion: migration and Testcontainers proof establish the schema, writer isolation, RLS join-through behavior, immutable matrix reference, and both pending/pre-existing lifecycle representations.

Tasks:
- [x] **Add forward-only V53/V54 approval persistence migrations.** Created `payment.payment_approvals`, `reference_data.approval_matrix_rules`, RLS join-through, owner grants, a partial queue index, immutable matrix-reference trigger, and nullable pre-FSM business-status representation.
      `verify: ./mvnw -f backend test -Dtest=ApprovalPersistenceMigrationTest` → PASS (2 tests; fresh PostgreSQL 18 and representative V52→V54 upgrade).
- [x] **Record the source-compatible representation decision.** `ADR-W7-01` keeps a pending payment's business status absent rather than inventing a lifecycle state; `RECEIVED` remains the no-approval path.
      `verify: ./mvnw -f backend test -Dtest=ApprovalPersistenceMigrationTest` → PASS (pending insertion accepts null status and ordinary V52 row remains `RECEIVED`).

## Story 76.2 — Approval-matrix evaluation and submission prefix gate

status: done
depends_on: [Story 76.1]

Description: Evaluate the supported single-payment matrix subset within the existing submission transaction.  `NOT_REQUIRED` creates an approval row and releases exactly one existing `payment.received`; `PENDING_APPROVAL` freezes the rule and maker identity, records a 24-hour expiry using `ClockPort`, and releases no event.

Completion criterion: JSON_DIRECT and pain.001 preserve archive/idempotency/lineage, replay is stable, policy ambiguity fails closed, and the no-approval flow remains backward-compatible.

Tasks:
- [x] **Implement the source-backed matrix subset and payment creation gate.** The first slice accepts exactly one active, tenant-wide rule with all optional selectors null.  `min_amount`, payment type, batch size, risk level and step-up are fail-closed unsupported; multiple active broad rules are a typed policy ambiguity.  JSON_DIRECT and pain.001 now create the approval row after lineage, and only `NOT_REQUIRED` releases the existing outbox event.
      `verify: ./mvnw -f backend test -Dtest=ApprovalSubmissionIntegrationTest,PaymentControllerTest,JsonDirectIngestionTest,Pain001SubmissionEndpointTest,PaymentServiceTest` → PASS (27 tests: pending/no-approval/replay/lineage/outbox/pain.001/controller proof); full backend regression → PASS (495 tests).

## Story 76.3 — Approve and reject commands with same-transaction audit

status: blocked
depends_on: [Story 76.2]

Description: Implement `POST /api/v1/payments/{paymentId}/approve` and `/reject` through payment-lifecycle with role, tenant/branch, maker≠checker, idempotency, conditional-transition and outbox-release guards.

Blocker: `audit.audit_log` is owned by the absent `evidence-audit` module, but the frozen security source requires every command to write an application audit row in the same transaction.  No existing audit port, schema, migration, module or independently owned planning story exists.  A payment-owned substitute would violate the accepted owner map.

Tasks:
- [ ] **Provide the evidence-audit command-audit capability.** Add it only under a source-derived owner with an explicit transaction boundary; do not substitute logs, status history, payment events, or outbox rows for audit.
      `verify: ./mvnw -f backend test -Dtest=ApprovalDecisionAuditIntegrationTest` → same-transaction audit/outbox/rollback proof passes.
- [ ] **Implement approve/reject once the audit port exists.** Use the source-defined conditional `PENDING_APPROVAL` update; first committed checker wins and a second gets a typed conflict.
      `verify: ./mvnw -f backend test -Dtest=ApprovalDecisionIntegrationTest` → authorization, idempotency, PostgreSQL race, rollback, and outbox-count proof passes.

## Story 76.4 — Approval expiry

status: blocked
depends_on: [Story 76.2, Story 76.3]

Description: A narrow service-role expiry capability changes only `PENDING_APPROVAL` rows past the frozen 24-hour limit to `EXPIRED`; it never starts the payment FSM or releases `payment.received`.

Blocker: expiry also requires the same authoritative application audit capability as decision commands.

Tasks:
- [ ] **Implement replay-safe expiry after the audit capability exists.** Use `ClockPort`, a narrow system identity and conditional transition semantics that cannot overwrite interactive terminal decisions.
      `verify: ./mvnw -f backend test -Dtest=ApprovalExpiryIntegrationTest` → expiry/replay/approve-vs-expire/reject-vs-expire/rollback proof passes.

## Story 76.5 — Module-owned approval queue/detail read model

status: not-started
depends_on: [Story 76.1]

Description: Provide a typed payment-lifecycle read model for pending single-payment approvals, tenant/branch-scoped through the payment owner, deterministic cursor pagination, and an honest expired-not-yet-processed representation.  It is internal until the frozen GraphQL read boundary has an owner.

Completion criterion: the read model exposes only decision-relevant fields and proves same-tenant/branch visibility, cross-tenant/branch denial, empty-GUC behavior and stable cursor ordering.

Tasks:
- [ ] **Implement and prove the internal approval queue/detail read model.** Keep it inside payment-lifecycle and do not add a one-off REST read endpoint or GraphQL implementation.
      `verify: ./mvnw -f backend test -Dtest=ApprovalQueueReadModelIntegrationTest` → PostgreSQL 18 queue cursor/RLS proof passes.

## Story 76.6 — Payments workspace approval queue and command UI

status: blocked
depends_on: [Story 76.3, Story 76.5, gate.graphql-owner]

Description: The `payment_approver` queue belongs in the existing Payments & Files workspace, with REST commands through the BFF and reads only through the established GraphQL boundary.

Blocker: no GraphQL read capability exists and `gate.graphql-owner` remains open.  The existing first-three-screens sequencing rule also keeps Playwright unavailable.

Tasks:
- [ ] **Expose the approved read contract and build the queue UI only after the GraphQL owner is decided.** Do not store browser tokens or add GraphQL mutations.
      `verify: pnpm run build && pnpm run lint && pnpm run typecheck` → PASS.

## Story 76.7 — Playwright maker–checker acceptance

status: blocked
depends_on: [Story 76.6, Story 24.1]

Description: Acceptance is deliberately separate from the backend and UI capability because Playwright remains gated until the first three screens exist.

Tasks:
- [ ] **Add maker→checker happy and negative acceptance after the sequencing gate opens.**
      `verify: pnpm run test:e2e -- --grep "@smoke.*maker-checker"` → PASS.

## Story 76.8 — Batch approval and item override

status: blocked
depends_on: [Story 76.3, EPIC-73-ingress-file-rail]

Description: Batch commands and item override are source-defined but require a real batch/file aggregate.  They are excluded from the single-payment slice.

Tasks:
- [ ] **Implement batch decision semantics only after the batch owner, membership and file capability exist.**
      `verify: ./mvnw -f backend test -Dtest=BatchApprovalIntegrationTest` → batch/group/override proof passes.
